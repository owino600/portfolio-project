          Abantu Poultry Management co.&trade; produces and sells chicken eggs.
          This breed of hens is bought at the age of 17 weeks. These chickens
          lay about 4 eggs at the beginning and rise to 6 to 7 eggs per week for
          a period of 5 to 7 months depending on the environment they are
          located. Eggs have a shelf life of 28 days.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="breeder" href="#home"> >> Breeder</a></h3>

        <p>
          Our Breeders are raised in breeding flocks under controlled conditions
          to ensure optimal reproduction and genetic diversity. These flocks are
          typically managed separately from other poultry flocks to maintain
          genetic integrity and prevent crossbreeding. The eggs laid by breeder
          hens are collected and incubated to hatch chicks, which are then
          raised either for meat production or as future breeders themselves.
        </p>

        <h3><a name="broiler" href="#home"> >> Broiler</a></h3>
        <p>
          Our Broilers are raised in controlled environments such as
          temperature-controlled poultry houses or barns. They are provided with
          optimal nutrition, access to clean water, and space to move around
          comfortably. Our broiler chickens are typically ready for slaughter
          within 6 to 8 weeks after hatching, depending on the breed and
          management practices.The meat from our broiler chickens is known for
          its tender texture and mild flavor, making it a popular choice for
          consumption worldwide.

        <h3><a name="hatchery" href="#home"> >> Hatchery</a></h3>

        <p>
          Hatcheries play a crucial role in the poultry industry by providing a
          controlled environment for the incubation of eggs, ensuring the
          production of healthy and viable chicks. They help meet the demand for
          poultry products by supplying farms with the next generation of birds
          for production. Here's how hatchery at Abantu Poultry Management co.™
          typically operates. for egg collection, Fertile eggs are collected
          from breeder flocks and carefully inspected for quality. Only eggs
          with intact shells and proper characteristics are selected for
          incubation. Incubation, The selected eggs are placed in specially
          designed incubators where conditions such as temperature, humidity,
          and ventilation are carefully controlled to mimic the natural process
          of egg incubation by a hen. These conditions are crucial for the
          development of the embryo inside the egg. For candling, during the
          incubation process, eggs are periodically "candled," which involves
          shining a bright light through the eggshell to observe the development
          of the embryo. This helps identify any non-viable eggs or
          abnormalities.Then it is followed by hatching, after a specific period
          of incubation (usually around 21 days for chicken eggs), the eggs
          hatch, and chicks emerge from the shells. The newly hatched chicks are
          fragile and require careful handling to ensure their health and
          well-being. Quality control then takes place, cnce hatched, the chicks
          are inspected for health and vitality. Any chicks showing signs of
          weakness or deformities may be culled to maintain the overall health
          of the flock.The newly hatched chicks are then typically transported
          to poultry farms where they will be raised for meat production or
          egg-laying.

          humanely slaughtered, processed, and prepared for distribution to
          consumers or further processing. Our slaughterhouses are designed to
          prioritize animal welfare and food safety standards, with procedures

          Abantu Poultry Management Co.™ procures various feed ingredients
          required for formulating poultry feed. These ingredients include
          grains like corn and wheat, protein sources such as soybean meal,
          vitamins, minerals, and other additives necessary for balanced
          nutrition.Once the feed ingredients are procured, Abantu Poultry

          nutritional requirements of the poultry we manage.We use the expertise
          of animal nutritionists to create feed formulations optimized for
          different stages of poultry growth, such as starter, grower, and
          finisher feeds for broilers, or layer feeds for egg-laying hens.
          Abantu Poultry Management Co.™ manufactures the feed ourselves using
          the feed mill facility. Alternatively,we may outsource the
          manufacturing process to a feed mill that specializes in producing
          poultry feeds according to our formulations. Quality control measures
          would be implemented at every stage of the feed manufacturing process
          to ensure that the feeds meet the required standards for nutrition,
          safety, and quality. This involves testing of raw materials,
          monitoring of manufacturing processes, and analysis of finished feed
          samples. Once the feed is manufactured, Abantu Poultry Management Co.™
          distributes the feed to our poultry farms or to other poultry farmers
          in their network. This may involve transportation logistics to ensure
          timely delivery of feed to our farms.Abantu Poultry Management Co.™

        <h3><a name="medicine" href="#home"> >> Madicine</a></h3>

        <p>
          We at Abantu Poultry Management Co.™, We utilize medicines to maintain
          the health and well-being of our flock. We implement preventive
          measures such as proper sanitation, biosecurity protocols, and
          vaccination programs to minimize the risk of disease outbreaks.
          Vaccines can be administered to prevent various viral and bacterial
          diseases commonly affecting poultry. We conduct regular health checks
          and monitor our flock to identify any signs of illnesses or diseases
          early. This allows for prompt intervention and treatment when
          necessary. In cases where our poultry show symptoms of illness, we
          work with a veterinarian to accurately diagnose the disease. This may
          involve laboratory testing and examination to determine the specific
          pathogens causing the problem. We develop treatment protocols based on
          the diagnosed diseases or health issues and use appropriate medicines
          such as antibiotics, antiparasitics, or antifungals as prescribed by
          the veterinarian. We ensure that the medicines are administered at the
          correct dosage and for the specified duration. We then maintain
          detailed records of medicine usage, including the type of medication,
          dosage administered, treatment duration, and any observed effects.
          This helps track the health status of individual birds and the overall
          flock, as well as ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. We
          Practice responsible use of medicines to minimize the development of
          antibiotic resistance and reduce the risk of residues in poultry
          products. Follow withdrawal periods as recommended by the veterinarian
          to ensure that no drug residues remain in the birds' systems at the
          time of slaughter. Alongside medication, we provide appropriate
          nutrition and access to clean water to support the birds' immune
          system and overall health. Nutritional supplements may be added to the
          feed if deficiencies are identified. We continuously monitor the
          effectiveness of the treatment protocols and make adjustments as
          needed. Evaluate the impact of medicine usage on the flock's health,
          performance, and productivity over time. By incorporating these
          practices, We at Abantu Poultry Management Co.™ effectively utilize
          medicine to promote the health and welfare of our poultry flock,
          ultimately contributing to the success of our poultry farming
          operations.
